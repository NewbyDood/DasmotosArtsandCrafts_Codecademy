## Welcome to GitHub Pages. This is my first page, a sample to see how this works in regard to deploying my student project to a sharable page.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/NewbyDood/DasmotosArtsandCrafts_Codecademy/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

**I'm not sure what else to put here right now.**<br>
*Okay*

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/NewbyDood/DasmotosArtsandCrafts_Codecademy/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
